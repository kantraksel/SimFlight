# SimFlight

A multiplayer crossplay between FlightGear and Flight Simulator X.

SimFlight is a SimConnect client, which allows to flight with other friends on FlightGear servers. However the app allows only one of many planned features.

## Status
Development has been ***indefinitely suspended*** due to lack of needed resources.

In current state SimFlight sends exact position of local airplane to FlightGear *servers*. The main problem is FG and FSX sceneries have different *ground levels*.
Most accurate altitude is at Frankfurt Airport (EDDF), but in Warsaw Airport (EPWA) airplane floats a few meters above ground. Other problem is that sometimes FG 
falls back to placeholder aircraft.

Other planned features:
- FlightGear aircrafts flying in FSX
- chat integration (through overlay)
